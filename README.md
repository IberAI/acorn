This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

### 1. Collaborative Workflow

#### For Each Developer:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/my-nextjs-app.git
   cd my-nextjs-app
   ```

2. **Create a Feature Branch:**
   ```sh
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

3. **Make Changes, Stage, and Commit:**
   ```sh
   # Make your changes in the code
   git add .
   git commit -m "Implement feature: your feature description"
   ```

4. **Push the Feature Branch to GitHub:**
   ```sh
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

5. **Create a Pull Request:**
   - Go to the repository on GitHub.
   - Click on "Compare & pull request".
   - Select the base branch (`develop`) and compare branch (`feature/your-feature-name`).
   - Fill in the pull request details and create the pull request.

### 2. Review and Merge Pull Requests

1. **Review the Pull Request:**
   - Team members review the code, provide feedback, and request changes if necessary.

2. **Make Any Requested Changes:**
   - Make changes locally if needed, commit, and push again:
     ```sh
     git add .
     git commit -m "Address review comments"
     git push origin feature/your-feature-name
     ```

3. **Merge the Pull Request:**
   - Once approved, merge the pull request into the `develop` branch on GitHub.

### 3. Keep `develop` Branch Updated

1. **Merge `develop` into `main` for Production:**
   - After testing and ensuring stability, merge `develop` into `main`:
     ```sh
     git checkout main
     git merge develop
     git push origin main
     ```
